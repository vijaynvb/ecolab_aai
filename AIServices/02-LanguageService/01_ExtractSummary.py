        "At Microsoft, we have been on a quest to advance AI beyond existing techniques, by taking a more holistic, "
        "human-centric approach to learning and understanding. As Chief Technology Officer of Azure AI Cognitive "
        "Services, I have been working with a team of amazing scientists and engineers to turn this quest into a "
        "reality. In my role, I enjoy a unique perspective in viewing the relationship among three attributes of "
        "human cognition: monolingual text (X), audio or visual sensory signals, (Y) and multilingual (Z). At the "
        "intersection of all three, there's magic-what we call XYZ-code as illustrated in Figure 1-a joint "
        "representation to create more powerful AI that can speak, hear, see, and understand humans better. "
        "We believe XYZ-code will enable us to fulfill our long-term vision: cross-domain transfer learning, "
        "spanning modalities and languages. The goal is to have pretrained models that can jointly learn "
        "representations to support a broad range of downstream AI tasks, much in the way humans do today. "
        "Over the past five years, we have achieved human performance on benchmarks in conversational speech "
        "recognition, machine translation, conversational question answering, machine reading comprehension, "
        "and image captioning. These five breakthroughs provided us with strong signals toward our more ambitious "
        "aspiration to produce a leap in AI capabilities, achieving multisensory and multilingual learning that "
        "is closer in line with how humans learn and understand. I believe the joint XYZ-code is a foundational "
        "component of this aspiration, if grounded with external knowledge sources in the downstream AI tasks."
