Embeddings convert text data into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, enabling more accurate search and retrieval by understanding context and similarity. Vector stores index these embeddings, allowing for quick and scalable similarity searches, essential for applications like recommendation systems, information retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. Combining both ensures high performance in accessing and utilizing vast amounts of text data."

Wow, just a few, not many. I'm surprised. Anyone from \\nstatistics? Okay, a few. So where are the rest of you from?  \\nStudent : iCME.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Say again?  \\nStudent : iCME.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : iCME. Cool.  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Civi and what else?  \\nStudent : [Inaudible]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Synthesis, [inaudible] systems. Yeah, cool.  \\nStudent : Chemi.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Chemi. Cool.  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Aero/astro. Yes, right. Yeah, okay, cool. Anyone else?  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon? MSNE. All right. Cool. Yeah.  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon?  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Endo —  \\nStudent : [Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Oh, I see, industry. Okay. Cool. Great, great. So as you can \\ntell from a cross-section of this class, I think we're a very diverse audience in this room, \\nand that's one of the things that makes this class fun to teach and fun to be in, I think.\")"
