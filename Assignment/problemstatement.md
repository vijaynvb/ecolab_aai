**Problem Statement: IT Support Chatbot**

Modern organizations face frequent IT support requests from employees, ranging from troubleshooting hardware and software issues to guidance on data backup and device compatibility. Traditional support channels, such as email or helpdesk tickets, can be slow and resource-intensive, leading to delays and reduced productivity.

The IT Support Chatbot aims to streamline and automate IT support by providing instant, accurate responses to common technical queries through a conversational interface. The chatbot should:

* Answer frequently asked IT support questions (e.g., troubleshooting devices, software installation, data backup).
* Guide users through basic troubleshooting steps.
* Escalate complex issues to human support when necessary.
* Operate via a user-friendly web interface for easy access.
* Respond politely to greetings and inform users that it is available to assist with IT support questions.
* Use the provided IT support context to answer IT-related queries.
* Politely decline if a question is out of context, clarifying that it can only handle IT-related questions.
* Reply with "I don't know" if the answer is unknown.
* Ensure all responses are short and concise, limited to no more than 2 sentences.
